    "Based on your analysis, develop 3 recommendations that will help EBI to better manage customer churn. Explain the rationale behind those 3 recommendations. • EBI has formulated a list of a subset of its current customers (see the dataset “ebi_exp_customers.csv” to answer this question) and would like to use your prediction model to take proactive measures to retain these customers. Specifically, the bank would target the customers (say, via telemarketing) who have high likelihood of churn. • Use your prediction model to predict the likelihood of churn for each customer in the dataset. • Suppose that the value of retaining a customer is €5 while the cost incurred by the bank to avoid a customer from churning is €1. How many and which customers from the dataset (“ebi_exp_customers.csv”) would you recommend the bank to target to maximize the total expected profit from this proactive targeting experiment? How would your answer change if the value of retaining a customer goes up to €10? Explain your computation"
